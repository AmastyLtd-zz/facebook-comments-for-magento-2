### Please your customers and yield the pros

Customers are usually busy people who have no time to waste. With our Magento 2 Facebook Comments, you will manage to respect your customers’ time and make their interaction with your store as seamless as possible. 

##### Build up customers’ trust 

Facebook is the place where people comment, react to comments by others, share their views and interact with each other ‘uncensored’. Why does it matter? People are more likely to leave their comments on Facebook and believe other opinions posted there. So, giving your customers a chance to speak and express their opinions about your products and services, you prove your reputation and build up customers’ trust.

##### Let customers comment on-the-go

Will your customers thank you for leaving feedback if it takes them about 30 minutes? Most likely, no. And if they do make it through a complex registration procedure, the bad experience will outweigh the good one. With our extension,  access to commenting is a matter of seconds. No login or sign up steps are required. To leave reviews on your product pages, customers only need to sign in via Facebook.

##### Allow customers to work with comments

Facebook comments are not some dead texts. Users can work with them -  edit, collapse, embed and delete. So allow them to do the same with the comments they live on your pages.

#####  Allow customers to duplicate reviews from product pages to Facebook

Posting a review in your store, a customer might want to express the opinion to a wider audience - people from their friend list and groups. Magento 2 Facebook Comments provides this opportunity. Leaving reviews on your store pages, customers can duplicate them to their Facebook profiles. This option makes customers happy and offers you a possibility to reach a bigger audience without any complex efforts.
